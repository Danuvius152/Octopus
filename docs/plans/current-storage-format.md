# Current storage and publication handoff

> **Status:** implemented — Validation and release handoff are tracked separately from production deployment.

The main database uses format **4**, and Wiki uses format **15**. Each database
has one `PRAGMA user_version` marker. An existing database must match exactly
before a writer opens; a genuinely empty database creates the complete current
layout and marker in one transaction. Startup does not interpret older layouts,
select upgrade routes, scan retired requests or backfill historical business data.

The declarations in `server/db/schema.py` and `server/wiki/schema_ddl.py` are the
current authorities. `server/storage_verification.py` verifies complete retained
layouts and current facts at publication. The marker is an admission check,
not evidence of content integrity. Current transaction failure handling, account
ownership, input recovery and Wiki filesystem/job recovery continue to apply.
Search, catalog, material hashes and maintenance projections remain rebuildable
under their existing owners; durable jobs, receipts, sources and event ledgers
are never recreated as caches.

## Publication boundary

The existing private publisher under `~/.octopus/ops/publication/tools/` owns
this sequence:

1. Inspect installation resources read-only before consuming the original
   process's single permit. A failed preflight leaves that service running.
2. Mask starts, switch the prepared release pointer and wait for the original
   process and unit to retire naturally.
3. Keep starts masked while checking the retained data, applying this release's
   finite conversion if needed, and verifying the candidate's current contract.
4. Install/unmask and start the candidate only after all resources pass. Verify
   actual readiness, current domain reads/writes and recovery, assets and the
   installation binding through the existing release acceptance.
5. Retire the finite conversion and its exclusive fixtures after acceptance and
   all recovery duties finish. Preserve decision rationale and regression evidence.

Unchanged formats still receive real read-only verification. Conversion, target
constraints and marker share one database transaction. Independent databases and
files do not form a global transaction: partial completion or an uncertain commit
keeps business closed. Reentry uses the original candidate/permit and fresh
inspection of committed facts; it does not trust an older success receipt, restore
old databases or replay model/tool effects. An already running candidate is
verified without another conversion or restart.

This release starts from the observed main 4 / Wiki 14 installation. Main has
no physical format change. The finite Wiki handoff drops the historical
`wiki_schema` table, installs current maintenance guards and commits marker 15.
It checks the retained original declaration read-only, compares exact durable
values before/after, rejects unconverted item evidence, and validates the current
layout before commit. Current-format task history and unknown execution references
remain. The original source and finite private script remain available until the
actual handoff is accepted; their presence is not a promise of future old-format
support. Implementing this code does not itself convert the running installation.

Only an actual structure or semantic change changes a format marker. Developer
intermediate layouts do not create support obligations. A later format-changing
release supplies its own bounded conversion and verification, then retires it;
there is no permanent older-version ladder or promise to open retired backups
with the newest binary. This work is independent of account portability tickets
19–22 and does not implement export/import.

## Regression coverage and retired assertions

| Previous assertion | Current coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Main 0–3 upgrades, retired columns/modes/requests and historical message guards | Their success matrices and frozen constructors/SQL are removed. Minimal mismatched-marker refusal remains, including nonempty zero and real WAL. |
| Current account/configuration, credentials, messages, input recovery, pins, schedules, attachments, applications, forks and delegations prepared through old fixtures | The same domain assertions use owned current data; current DEKs, password changes, unknown inputs and successor relationships remain covered. |
| Full current structure/constraint checks during startup | Publication tests retain missing indexes, quoted SQL constraints, extra structures, lost origin/source/grant/selection authority and read-only refusal. |
| Wiki 12/13 preparation, no-jobs layouts, old emitters and task retirement | Old success matrices and frozen DDL are removed. Current grants/material ingestion, creation receipts, blob roots, notifications and metadata recovery use registered current Wiki fixtures. |
| Wiki format history | One current marker; mismatch rejection, current reopening and derived-index recovery. Current tasks are retained. |
| Startup performs release upgrades | Private publication tests verify retirement before conversion, masked failures, fresh reentry, actual SQLite process loss/commit acknowledgment loss, partial completion across two Wiki ledgers and current service behavior after handoff. |

Targeted checks precede the repository commit gates. Gate definitions and live
provider scope remain in [AGENTS](../../AGENTS.md#verification); deployment follows
[the existing local procedure](../local-wsl.md#自动发布). Passing isolated conversion
or startup tests does not establish that production was converted or released.
